<p>The father of communism, Karl Marx, was inspired by Hegel. Marx wrote about class struggle and the ills of capitalism, believing communism to be the next phase after the eventual collapse of capitalism. Marx also wrote about how capitalism negatively affects the everyday man through his dialectics, known as the Marxist dialectic.
