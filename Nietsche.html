<h1>Nietsche</h1>
<img src="/Images/Nietzsche.jpeg" height="300">
<p>The man who went to war with religion (not really, but you will learn more about that when you read his work), Friedrich Nietzsche, was a famous German philosopher whose philosophy was about achieving human greatness and the ways to achieve it. His ideas included freeing the spirit, the concept that trauma can be beneficial, and the proclamation that "God is dead." It is important to note that he had a mental breakdown. His sister went on to corrupt his unfinished work, promoting European supremacy and racial ideas that Nietzsche most likely would have opposed.
