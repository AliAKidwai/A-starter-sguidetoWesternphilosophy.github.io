<img src="/Images/Machiavelli.jpeg" height="300">
<p>The Italian diplomat Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, who inspired the character of Darth Sidious, believed in using others and forgoing ethics. He is well known for the famous quote about being "a wolf in sheep's clothing." His main philosophy was about using cunning and sometimes unethical means to achieve one's goals. He famously wrote "The Prince," a book often regarded as a handbook for dictators.
