    <h1>Why even bother with philosophy!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Why should one be interested in philosophy? The answer is simple: philosophy is embedded in our daily lives so much that we often forget about it. Let's think of mathematics. Pythagoras famously invented the Pythagorean theorem—shocking, I know. His cult is also credited with discovering imaginary numbers. You wouldn’t expect to learn about math on a philosophy website, would you? Many more concepts like that can be found in philosophy, such as Karl Marx and communism, Aristotle and ethics, Niccolò Machiavelli and rulership, and so much more. Most importantly, philosophy is a great tool for critical thinking.</p>
