<img src="/Images/Plato.png" height="300">
<p>Plato, the famous student of Socrates and teacher to Aristotle, delved into metaphysics in his philosophy and wrote extensively about his teacher Socrates' philosophy. Learning about Plato is also learning about Socratesâ€”two birds, one stone. Some of his famous ideas and works include the Allegory of the Cave, Theory of Forms, and the concept of the Philosopher King.
