    <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky is the most unique philosopher on the list. Instead of writing essays or theses to express his philosophical ideas, he wrote books. He was a Russian novelist who underwent a massive change in his ideas when he was arrested and sent to a gulag in Siberia. From a socialist, he became a more traditional conservative. In his books, he wrote about the dangers of ambition, critiqued the many different forms of ethics that started to emerge, such as utilitarianism, and critiqued the intellectual class.
